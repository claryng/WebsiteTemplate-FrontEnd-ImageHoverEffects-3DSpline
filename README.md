# WebsiteTemplate-FrontEnd-ImageHoverEffects-3DSpline

## Description
This website is a collection of image hover effects that I learned on Youtube. It includes a 3D interactive character that I built with Spline. Hover around the first intro page to play around with light direction and hover over the cone to see special effect.
